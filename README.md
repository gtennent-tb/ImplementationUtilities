# ImplementationUtilities

RIFF: Rapid Implementation and Feed Framework (named by implementation :) )

Random scripts, tools, tricks, and hacks related to implementation should go here.
One day, it should be the ultimate toolbox for a Technical Implementation / Technical Consulting team

Setup:
1.) clone this
2.) cd ImplementationUtilities
3.) npm install -g
4.) [might need this, not sure] chmod u+x ./src/index.ts

See instructions for the CLI by typing 'riff'
